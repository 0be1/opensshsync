OpenSSHSync
===========

A plugin for [KeePass](http://keepass.info)

Using this plugin you can synchronize your password database using OpenSSH, which must be installed on your computer, as a client.

Just *Open URL* or *Save as URL* on the *File* menu an provide an URL starting with **sftp://**

For now, you must use RSA Authentication through the SSH Agent.

The Password Authentication is not yet implemented.

You can extensively use the OpenSSH SSH client configuration files (man ssh_config) to customize your URL.
